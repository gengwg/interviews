Three Coding Questions:
You can choose whatever language you prefer to solve these problems, though at least two of the solutions 
should be written in a high-level programming language such as Python [vs. a shell such as bash].

Question 1:
----------
Given a folder of build files that might look like this:

/Build-1.dmg
/Build-2.dmg
/Build-2.1.dmg
/Build-2.1.1.dmg
/Build-3.dmg
/Build-3.2.dmg
/Build-3.19.dmg

Write a script that takes a path to the folder as an argument, and prints the highest build number (just the number, i.e. 2.1.1)
Note:  The first digit can go up to 999 and should always be present, but the second and third can only go up to 99, and might not be included.


Question 2:
----------
Write a script that outputs the network interfaces on a system with the corresponding IP addresses in CIDR format.  
Bonus points for including IPv6 addresses.


Question 3: 
----------
USGS (US Geological Survey) publishes various earthquake data as JSON feed. Hereâ€™s a feed spanning all domestic earthquakes from the past week:
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson

Using this JSON feed:
1) identify every earthquake in California from past week,
2) list them chronologically (ascending),
3. and finally output in a format resembling the following e.g.:

2017-07-13T20:43:37+00:00 | 3km NW of Greenville, California | Magnitude: 1
2017-07-13T22:09:53+00:00 | 41km SW of Ferndale, California | Magnitude: 2.76
2017-07-13T22:31:04+00:00 | 11km E of Mammoth Lakes, California | Magnitude: 1.31
2017-07-13T22:32:48+00:00 | 15km SE of Mammoth Lakes, California | Magnitude: 0.92
2017-07-13T22:37:52+00:00 | 12km E of Mammoth Lakes, California | Magnitude: 0.95
2017-07-13T22:45:28+00:00 | 37km SE of Bridgeport, California | Magnitude: 1.7
2017-07-13T22:49:58+00:00 | 8km ENE of Mammoth Lakes, California | Magnitude: 0.92
2017-07-13T22:54:30+00:00 | 3km SE of Atascadero, California | Magnitude: 2.04
